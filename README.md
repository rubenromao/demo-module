# demo-module
This is from a Macademy course I did. It tries to cover the most common M2 concepts and design patterns.

This module covers the app structure, how routing & controllers work, how to extend core code,
dependency injection & interfaces, different design patterns and usages, ways to modify the page layout, and understand data management.
